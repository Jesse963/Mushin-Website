  "summary": "A major logistics provider struggled with slow, error-prone manual data entry from diverse ULD receipts across multiple distribution centres. Mushin Automation implemented a scalable AI (Google Vision + custom model) and RPA (UiPath) solution, cutting processing time from ~105 seconds to ~8 seconds per ULD, saving an estimated $80k annually, and reducing errors significantly.",
  "challenge": {
    "title": "The Challenge: Inefficient and Costly ULD Receipt Processing",
    "content": "Processing hundreds of Unit Load Devices (ULDs) daily, the client relied on time-consuming manual data extraction from diverse receipts, including handwritten ones. An existing automated scanner solution at one site was expensive, inflexible regarding formats, nearing obsolescence, and couldn't be scaled cost-effectively across the entire distribution network, creating a major operational bottleneck."

    "title": "The Solution: AI-Powered Data Extraction & Automated Entry",
    "content": "Mushin Automation designed and implemented a comprehensive, scalable solution combining Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation:",
    "bulletPoints": [
      "**Intelligent Data Extraction:** Leveraged Google Cloud Vision API, enhanced by a custom AI model trained by Mushin, to accurately read and extract data from various receipt formats, including handwritten text.",
      "**Automated Validation & Entry:** Employed UiPath RPA to automatically validate the extracted data against business rules and accurately enter it into the client's tracking system.",
      "**Scalable & Cost-Effective Design:** Created a software-based solution easily deployable across all distribution centres, eliminating the need for expensive, specialised hardware at each site."
